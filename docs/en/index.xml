      <description>My name is Naoko Gibson. I&amp;rsquo;m a qualified IAIM infant massage instructor, and I also work as a teacher at a local nursery. Thank-you for looking at my site.
I decided to become an infant massage instructor, because I am interested in the possibilities that infant massage brings to improve the bond between children and their carers at this early stage of life.
Massage is a form of communication, and through lessons with Basking in the Sun, I hope to help babies and their carers feel like they are enjoying time together in the sunshine, even if it&amp;rsquo;s rainy or cloudy outside.</description>

 Provide relaxation.
 May stimulate their digestive and immune systems.
