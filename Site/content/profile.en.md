My name is Naoko Gibson. I'm a qualified IAIM infant massage instructor, and
I also work as a teacher at a local nursery. Thank-you for looking at my site.

I decided to become an infant massage instructor, because I am interested in
the possibilities that infant massage brings to improve the bond between children
and their carers at this early stage of life.

Massage is a form of communication, and through lessons with Basking in the Sun,
I hope to help babies and their carers feel like they are enjoying time together
in the sunshine, even if it's rainy or cloudy outside.

I also hold a qualification in paediatric first aid, and have been DBS checked.
